This project has source code and binary file which can be programmed to MKE04Z8VFK4 NXP processor.

Note: I wrote and compiled the code on Kinetis Design Studio which was installedon Linux Machine (Ubuntu 16.04), but it should also run on Windows. 

Download and install Kinetis Design Studio (KDS) from NXP website. I used following link. 
"https://www.nxp.com/products/wireless-connectivity/zigbee/kinetis-design-studio-integrated-development-environment-ide:KDS_IDE?tab=Design_Tools_Tab#nogo"

I used linux version of KDS. 
We don't need to have KSDK installed on our computer or inside KDS as KSDK doesn't support this processor.

More or less I followed following youtube tutorial to make current toggle functionality work.
